# Greeting Card Generator
### Project 5: Binding for Typography & Interaction 2 (2025)

A greeting card can be a simple yet effective way to celebrate and acknowledge loved ones during special occasions. Yet, picking up a pre-made  card from a store to write on can feel a tad impersonal. A dynamic greeting card generator transforms this experience from generic to meaningful by presenting a personalized, digital alternative (especially when the only way to connect with certain loved ones is online)! 

This project aims to reinvent the traditional greeting card by integrating generative design and customizable messaging. Users can start off by selecting a theme (with dynamically generated design elements), and customize text, colors, and positions from there. Once finished, the generator allows users to download their final design as a PNG file (if they wish to print it out), or view their design as an interactive greeting card to be sent digitally.  Combining personalization with generative design ensures that no two cards are ever the same, making each card feel deeply thoughtful and one-of-a-kind. :)
